        <h3><span style="color:indianred"><u>How to Place an Order</u></span></h3>
Please contact us via email, phone, or live chat to make changes to your order. We're happy to assist in any way!  
  
<h3><span style="color:indianred"><u>Billing</u></span></h3>
We accept major credit and most debit cards: VISA, MasterCard, DISCOVER, and American Express. We do not accept pre-paid cards, gift
credit cards, virtual card #s or temporary bank cards (those that do not have your name on them). We also donâ€™t accept cards which are
not US based. We hate to do it, but orders placed on these types of cards are automatically cancelled from the system.
        

      

<h3><span style="color:indianred"><u>Transit Delays</u></span></h3>
For the vast majority of orders, the carrier will arrive on time so you shouldn't have to worry! We recommend giving yourself a 1-3 day
buffer, especially for important events. If you experience a delay, please contact us so we can help immediately! If possible, we will
attempt to send a replacement order your way ASAP. In this case we'd also offer a refund for the outbound shipping and begin your rental
when it arrives, or offer a refund for the delayed day. Otherwise, we will have the order rerouted back to us and will issue a full
refund once the order has been returned.   
  
   
  
<h3><span style="color:indianred"><u>Deposits</u></span></h3>
More than 99% of the orders we process do not require a deposit. Some of our very expensive gear will require proof of 3rd party
insurance. When insurance isn't possible, we often request a deposit. We understand it can be inconvenient or in some cases not feasible 
to put down a large deposit and we will always communicate with you before charging any deposit. We evaluate every order and do reserve
the right to ask for a deposit if we feel it's necessary. In all cases, we will do our best to work with you towards the best solution 
for both parties!.
